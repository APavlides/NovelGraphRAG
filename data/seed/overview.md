# The Liminal Space

This literary ghost story follows David, a 43-year-old chronic over-analyzer who arrives at his deceased mother's house in Dunwich, Suffolk, following her funeral. The house sits 30 feet from a crumbling cliff edge, doomed by coastal erosion to fall into the sea within 18-24 months.

David has spent his life trying to rationalize away emotional pain, keeping himself distant from genuine experience. But faced with his mother's impending erasure and haunted by the ghosts of his own missed connections, he must learn to feel rather than understand.

## Central Themes

- Logic vs. feeling as approaches to life's mysteries
- Impermanence and the futility of trying to control the uncontrollable
- The difference between understanding and accepting
- Art as response to temporal existence
- Connection missed through over-analysis
- Learning to live with uncertainty

## Setting & Atmosphere

Dunwich—a liminal Suffolk village where most of the medieval town already lies beneath the North Sea. The constant, patient pressure of coastal erosion creates a perfect metaphor for human impermanence. The drowned town's legendary church bells hint at supernatural elements.

## Tone

Quiet, contemplative, and elegiac. This is literary fiction that uses supernatural elements not for horror but for emotional truth—ghosts as manifestations of regret, missed chances, and the parts of ourselves we've tried to analyze away.
